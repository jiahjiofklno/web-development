    <p><b>Dantakali Temple, Bijayapur hills</b>
September 17, Kathmandu.Dantakali Temple is situated in the middle of the beautiful hillock of Bijayapur in Dharan. The holy temple of Dantakali is famous among the Hindus as the place where lies the sacred tooth of the goddess Satidevi, the consort of the great god Mahadev. According to the myth, a tooth of the deceased wife of lord shiva fell off on this spot while shiva was outrageously traveling on the earth carrying his dead wife. So, this temple was established here in commemoration of the Lord Shiva's wife. The fallen tooth is said to be very much look alike of a human being itself and today it is still believed to be preserved.

This location, where the Dantakali Temple is built, is believed to house the sacred teeth of Goddess Parvati.

<p>This Hindu temple is located at the end of the main road of Vijayapur Hill at its highest point, in a remote forested area. I came early in the morning so there weren’t many people here.
There are 2 small temples on this site but, overall, the site is quite plain. The main one has some nice carvings and statues but, overall, it was the least interesting of the 4 main temples to see in Dharan. However, there were monkeys running around the forest and sneaking into the temple grounds to eat rice used during prayer.
 Two old ladies in the temple gave me a prayer and painted a dot on my forehead, then charged me an absurd amount, 100 rupees. I suggest to not let them do this to you.
 Out of the 4 temples in Vijayapur Hill, if you have to miss one of them, this would be the one.</p>
